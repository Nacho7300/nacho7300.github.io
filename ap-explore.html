          <p> <b>2A)</b>The computing innovation I chose is Amazon Alexa. (5)The purpose of Amazon Alexa is so you can ask Alexa anything and it will know and answer. It works by you asking or giving a command to one of the speakers and then it processes the information and they it will complete the action that was given. This artifact shows that Alexa is beneficial artificial intelligence  for many people that are busy or need help most of the time.
          </p>
          
          
            <p><b>2B)</b>I created this artifact by using an image editing app. The program I used to create this artifact is GIMP. First, I got pictures from google that had something  to do with Amazon  Alexa.
Then, I made a collage using the images explaining the artifact.</p>
        
            <p><b>2C)</b>The innovation called Amazon Alexa is a  smart speaker that helps turn your house become smart by connecting Alexa to your lights and other things into your house by just commanding it with your voice. This innovation is beneficial because it helps disabled people who can not move around their house to do many actions, without Alexa they will need help from someone else to do it for them.(1) On the other hand, this innovation is harmful because someone can record/listen your conversation and when your conversations are recorded the police can use that against you. A potential benefit to society is that your house becomes smarter and you move less to do things that can be done by Alexa.
            </p>
            
            <p><b>2D)</b>The data Amazon Alexa uses is your voice when you talk to it. (2)The data is generated by changing your voice to commands which enables devices record or stream audio pieces of what you said. (3) Amazon Alexa creates data by sending the files recorded of your voice to a server to process the audio and turn it into an answer.  The data is changed by changing your voice into files and then into a command. (4)A concern is privacy since Alexa might share your conversations that are private with its developers.
